1: Arithmetic Mean (AM)
----------------------
https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/mean-machine.html

x¯=1n∑ni=1xi,

     n
AM = ∑ xi   / n
     i =1
     
AM = x1+x2+x3+....xn/n

 

2: Mean Deviation (MD)

avg =  10.6  # arithmetic_mean
x1 = 4, x2 = 8
x1-avg => deviation

sum = 0 (always)
sum = mod of each value

The sum of mod deviation  know as mean deviation
     n       _   
AM = ∑ |Xi - x  / n
     i =1
     
Coefficient of MD = MD/AM


3: Standard Deviation (SD)
-------------------------
https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html

SD (σ)
σ = sqrt( 
     n       _   
(∑ |Xi - x  )/ **2 n-1
     i =1
)

4: Correlation
--------------
https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/correlation.html

the relationship between two variables such that a change in one variable
results in a positive or negative change in the other variable is known as
correlation.

Regression analysis is the method used for estimating the unknown value of one 
variable corresponding to the known value of another variable
