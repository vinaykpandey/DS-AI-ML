Data Science
---------------
DS focuses on data modeling and data warehousing to track the ever-growing dataset

DS uses ML to analyze data and make predictions about the future


Machine Learning
---------------
ML is sub set of AI
ML provides computer system the ability to automatically learn and improve the experience


Artificial Intelligence
------------------------
AI is an area of CS that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans


Types of AI
--------------
Narrow AI: specific domain equal to human (In used in market)
General AI: equal to human (R&D)
Super AI: greater to human (R&D)

AI fields
-------------
Natural Language Processing
Neural Network
Robotics
Cognitive Computing
Deep Learning
Machine Learning


Types of ML
---------------
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning

Supervised Learning
-------------------
Goal is to train system with given labeled data, so that it can predict target values
eg: Identify the Fruit
Two types of Supervised Learning Algorithms
1: Regression(predicts continuous value outputs)
2: Classification(predicts discrete value outputs)

-: The difference between the tow is that fact that the dependent attribute is numeric
    for regression and categorical for classification
eg: future weather (Regression), fruits (Classification)

Unsupervised Learning
---------------------
-: Used in clustering problems
-: Data is not labeled
eg: Grouping movies based on user ratings
    clustering customer according to their buying habits

Reinforcement Learning
-----------------------
:- Its a type of dynamic programming
:- Train using reward and punishment
:- Algo learns by interacting with its environment
eg: Self driving car , Chess Game
